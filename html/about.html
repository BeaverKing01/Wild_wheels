        <h2>What is slotcar racing?</h2>
		<br />
		<p>For those who have been around the block a few times "scalectrics” might be more enlightning. Though "scalectrics” is a brand name and only use plastic tracks. For those who have not heard of either, here are the basics. A slotcar track is a miniature race track made from plastic or wood. Plastic tracks are built up by linking various short pieces of track into different formations. The track is laid out on the floor or a large table. The Wild Wheels track is a wooden track with its own legs. Unlike the flat track it changes height and has bank turns, a "doughnut" and a bridge. The track is 20 metres long and has six lanes. On a slotcar track each lane has a groove in which the cars run.</p> 
<br />
<p>Slotcars are made plastic or custom made with carbon fibre and are scale models of real cars. Mostly 1:24 or 1:32 & 1:48 scale models. While the car's wheels run on the track, a small guide under the chassis runs in the groove. The cars are not battery operated or radio controlled. They get their current from the track itself. The track runs on about 12 volts. The cars are operated by a hand held controller, plugged into the driver station. The controller has a sensitive lever that gets pulled to increase or decrease speed and an adjustment knob for the brakes. Each controller only controls one lane and therefore one car. It is simple to drive a slotcar but takes skill to drive well. Most normal driving principles apply. Going too fast around an inside corner is bound to make the car roll. A car that leaves its lane will be placed back in the groove by a marshal but you will loose valuable seconds.</p> 
<br />
<p>The cars can drive amazingly fast. The average novice driver in an entry level car, can complete a 20m lap in 7 seconds. An advance driver with a suped up car, can drive the same lap in about 4 seconds. The Wild Wheels track also comes with software and display screens. This allows a Formula One start, with race lights and display realtime stats. Participant's names can be typed in and it will display race positions, fastest laps, remaining minutes etc.</p> 
<br />
<p>Slotcar racing can be highly competitive and enthusiasts spend as much time on their cars as on racing. They buy their cars in kit form and construct, paint and decal it themselves. Each individual part of the car can be changed to enhance performance, like different gear ratios, axels, or rims. Tires are changed according to track conditions and there are a big variety available, mostly made from foam, silicon or rubber.</p>
<br />
<p>A big advantage of slotcar racing is that everyone can compete on the same foot. It is the one sport where you do not have to be sporty to win. It is also a wonderful sport for disabled people. Men have no advantage over woman and once women overcome their initial restraint they often beat their partners and have great fun in the process. It is a far cry from cellphone and computer games and kids just love watching their cars go round the track. It is great family fun. Slotcar racing is a unique experience and once you get going it is hard to put that controller down Just one more lap, just a little faster around the next bend...</p>
<br />
<h3>Sixties fun with a modern twist</h3>
<br />
<p>Slotcar racing is popular all over the world and in recent years there has been a surge of interest, especially in America and Europe. As a result companies are utilising the latest technology to stay on the forefront of innovation and a huge array of cars, parts and controllers are available. In South Africa slotcar racing was very popular in the sixties and seventies. Many people share their fond memories with us about how they use to set up a plastic track in their garage and race entire weekends. Today there are about 20 slotcar clubs in the country, with members competing to take part in the nationals and to represent SA at the world champs.</p>
