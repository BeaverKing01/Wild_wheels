		<h2>Parties</h2>
<br />
<p>Slotcar parties are exhilarating fun for all ages. In one weekend we go from preschool party, to girl's teenage party to fortieth birthday bash. Wild Wheels offers you the opportunity to have a party with a difference. It is very unlikely that your friends have been to a slotcar party and if they have, they will be super excited to come to yours! Wild Wheels have a range of new cars in the pipeline: Lightning Mc Queen* and the gang from CARS for the little ones, flower power sixties beetles for a feminine touch and group c and Le Mans cars for the serious racer all in the large 1:24 scale. Watch the website or our facebook page to see when these will be available. </p>
<br />
<h4>Corporate events and team building</h4>
<br />
<p>If you want to give your staff a real treat, book the supersix raceway. You will see your co-workers in a new light, as they forget about the stress, relax and wheelspin down the straight. Participants can race in teams or relay enduro events and it creates a wonderful sense of camaraderie and team spirit. The advantage of slotcar racing is that you don't need to be sporty, have the gift of the gab, or be willing to jump off cliffs. Young or old, male or female, graduate or not, everyone competes on equal footing.</p>
<br />
<h4>School fundraisers, church fetes and charity events</h4>
<br />
<p>Foodstalls, crafts, a jumping castle... Why not add something unique to your event? The supersix raceway is the largest portable wooden slotcar track in the country. It is not expensive to race and it is free to watch. Once the cars start zooming the crowds start gathering. Young and old love it and it is a real crowd pleaser. Add some excitement to your next event, at no cost to you.</p>
<br />
<h4>Party Hire</h4>
<br />
<p>We cater for children, teenagers and adults.</p>
<br />
<p>Although some two-year-olds can drive independently, the recommended starting age for parties is three or four (depending on skill level and concentration span).</p>
<br />
<p>The track can be set up indoors or outdoors (weather permitting)
Please read the space and access requirements.</p>
<br />
<p>The track takes about 60 to 90 minutes to set up, depending on ease of access, levelness of surface etc. It takes about 30 to 60 minutes to dissemble. Your booked time will only start once the track is operational.</p>
<br />
<p>Wild Wheels supply the track and the cars and a track manager. The track manager will manage the track and the racing and guide the participants. The track manager does not take control of the party. Where children are involved, they will still be the responsibility of their parents or the hostess.</p>
<br />
<p>Marshalling (replacing derailed cars) is usually done by participants not racing at the time. It is part of the fun and keeps everyone engaged. You can also book marshals for your party at additional cost.</p>

<p>Wild Wheels supply the track and the cars and a track manager. The track manager will manage the track and the racing and guide the participants. For corporate events we usually also include marshals, who are positioned around the track and replace derailed cars. This is optional for team building as marshalling can also be done by participants not racing at the time.</p>
