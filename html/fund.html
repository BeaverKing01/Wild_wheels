        <h2>School fundraisers, church fetes and charity events</h2>
<br />
<p>Foodstalls, crafts, a jumping castle... Why not add something unique to your event? The supersix raceway is the largest portable wooden slotcar track in the country. It is not expensive to race and it is free to watch. Once the cars start zooming the crowds start gathering. Young and old love it and it is a real crowd pleaser. Add some excitement to your next event, at no cost to you.</p>
<br />
<br />
<p>There is no cost to the organisation. We will set up and manage the track and the drivers.  We will charge participants a set fee per race. each race has a time limit of two or three minutes and six racers can participate at the same time. We usually work with cash but can also accept tokens or tickets if that is the system you are using for the event. Twenty percent of the profits of the day will go to the organisation/charity.</p> 
<br />
<p>Our requirements are: an indoor or outdoor space large enough to accommodate the track and all the onlookers. Trailer access as close to the point of set up as possible,  a fairly level surface and a reliable power point within 20 meters.</p>
<br />
<p>Wild Wheels is only available for booking at events that can give an assurance of the expected turnout. Please supply us with the approximate number of visitors at your previous year's event.</p>
